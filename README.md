# OOPSBannerApp_UC6
UC6 refactors the OOPS Banner App by introducing static helper methods to generate character patterns dynamically instead of relying on hardcoded inline array initialization.  This version enhances the application's modularity, readability, and maintainability while preserving the same visual banner output.
